				Design notes for Slippr
				=======================

		NOT PRIVATE: NOW IN VERSION CONTROL

Slippr was intended to provide a quick way to produced minimalist
web sites. The expectation was that these would look quite similar
to my Wordpress sites having :

	A single index file which selects and assembles the content, in
		a similar manner to Noof.

	A header and footer that apply to all pages (Version info can be
		inserted at time of deployment).

	A one-word menu across the to corresponding to magazine sections
		This would select the directory containing the related info -
		the Context.

	A menu on the RHS with explanatory text
		This selects a file which is included for the LHS.

	A main (LHS) panel which is filled with a file selected by the menu
		 on the RHS, but with a default.

This was built and it was soon discovered that the trick was to have an Example
directory which iss over-written on deployment. This holds instructions
on how to deploy which are normally hidden from end users.

Placement of pictures in text still needs work. Current thinking is
to divide the LHS DIV into rows and columns using the Bootstrap tools.
