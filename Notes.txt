				Design notes for Slippr 1.0
				===========================

		NOT PRIVATE: NOW IN VERSION CONTROL

Slippr was intended to provide a quick way to produced minimalist
web sites. The expectation was that these would look quite similar
to my Wordpress sites having :

	A single index file which selects and assembles the content, in
		a similar manner to Noof.

	A header and footer that apply to all pages (Version info can be
		inserted at time of deployment).

	A one-word menu across the to corresponding to magazine sections
		This would select the directory containing the related info -
		the Context.

	A menu on the RHS with explanatory text
		This selects a file which is included for the LHS. There is a
		contact form which can be optionally placed here.  

	A main (LHS) panel which is filled with a file selected by the menu
		 on the RHS, but with a default.
		 
	In order to keep conplexity down, Slippr does not use a database. (I
		have had a similar, but more complex framwork for several years
		which does support databases, but it is not OSS).

Slippr uses an Example directory which is over-written on deployment. This holds 
instructions on how to deploy which are normally hidden from end users. (it was 
called "Default" in version 1.0). 

General practice for pictures is to divide the LHS DIV into rows and columns using 
the Bootstrap tools. 

Version 1.0 seems quite stable - it has been used for at least four websites without
any need for updates. 

Version 2 will support e-commerce (a shopping car and card payment using Stripe). To
support this, it will use a different way (Session variables) to propagate the current 
page and context. The user experience will be identical between the two versions, but
you may need to modify some/all of the menus you have created yourself to upgrade.
