					Design notes for Slippr
					=======================

				   NOT PRIVATE: NOW ON GITHUB

Slippr was intended to provide a quick way to produced minimalist
web sites. The expectation was that these would look similar to my 
Wordpress sites (Which they will eventually replace) having:

	A single index file which selects and assembles the content, in
		a similar manner to Noof.

	A header and footer that apply to all pages (Version info can be
		inserted at time of deployment).

	An optional one-word menu across the top corresponding to magazine sections.
		This selects a directory containing the related info - the Context.
		Small websites may only have one cotext, in which case this menu can
		be safely omitted. 

	A menu on the RHS with explanatory text (the page menu).
		This selects a file which is included for the LHS. 
		A contact form is available which can be included in this area
		with or without the menu. Where the context has only a single
		page, this menu can be omitted. 

	A main (LHS) panel which is filled with a file selected by the menu
		 on the RHS, but with a default. 

	I will experiment with an add-on for e-commerce.

This was built and it was soon discovered that the trick was to have an Example
directory which is over-written on deployment. This holds instructions
on how to deploy which are normally hidden from end users. This is currently 
called "Default", but should be renamed "Support".
