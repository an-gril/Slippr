					Design notes for Slippr Version 2
					=================================

				   		NOT PRIVATE: NOW ON GITHUB

Slippr was intended to provide a quick way to produced minimalist
web sites. The expectation was that these would look similar to my 
Wordpress sites (Which they will eventually replace) having:

	A single index file which selects and assembles the content.

	A header and footer that apply to all pages (Version info can be
		inserted at time of deployment).

	An optional one-word menu across the top corresponding to the Contexts.
		This selects a directory containing the related info - the Context.
		Small websites may only have one context, in which case this menu can
		be safely omitted. 

	An Example Context is supplied which contains the instructions on how to 
		implement a site. 

	A menu on the RHS with explanatory text (the page menu).
		This selects a file which is included for the LHS. 
		A contact form is available which can be included in this area
		with or without the menu. Where the context has only a single
		page, this menu can be omitted. The RHS is used for the shopping
		cart in an e-commerce Context.

	A main (LHS) panel which is filled with a file selected by the menu
		 on the RHS, but with a default of Home.php. Home.php is selected
		by any change of Context caused by the main menu. Programmed
		changes of COntext can select a new Page at the same time.

	E-commerce operation can cause page changes. Stripe integration requires
		specific pages in the root environment. This set the actual Page
		required - and may set other variables, before invoking index.php.

	During development, you are expected to maintain all your private work
		in version control and checkout from there. You may want several
		copies of your site - your own work will normally be confined to the
		directory local. (Examples are in lib/local). If you have site-specific
		data (eg encryption keys) this data should be in files that are not
		under version control (for security). (You will still need backup ;-)
